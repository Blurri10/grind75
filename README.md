This repository is a collection of all the solutions I've submitted on LeetCode while solving problems from [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?weeks=4&difficulty=Easy&difficulty=Medium&difficulty=Hard&hours=20&grouping=topics). You can customize this list according to your requirements.

The files are named after their problem number and title on LeetCode for easy access (eg. `0169 Majority Element`).

Each solution file contains a metadata section at the start. This includes the following info for each solution:
1. **Title**
2. **Date Submitted** (If a solution was updated/improved, the submission dates are sorted with the most recent ones first)
3. **Time Taken To Solve**
4. **Time Complexity**
5. **Space Complexity**
6. **Notes** (optional, but I've still added them in for future references)

The file then contains the solution itself. If any of the solutions were replaced/updated by me with a better solution, the most recent one is written first and the rest are commented chronologically below it.
